        detail2:"Citrus sinensis is the common orange we eat, but there are many other varieties with different uses. Common examples are the Seville orange or bitter orange (Citrus aurantium) and Bergamot orange (Citrus bergamia). All are trees with white fragrant flowers and spherical orange fruits, and by and large they all originated in Southeast Asia. The medicinal uses of Citrus aurantium were first recorded in Chinese medical literature dating back to 200 CE. It’s thought that all oranges were brought to Europe in the 12th century by Portuguese sailors and first cultivated in Italy.Therapeutic uses Anaemia & nutrient sourceBy increasing iron absorption from foods, oranges and orange juice have been shown to reduce anaemia. Oranges are also a reasonable source of absorbable folic acid.Cardiovascular health Population studies have shown a strong correlation between eating diets high in vegetables and fruit and improvement in cardiovascular health. One experiment tested 24 adults with both high cholesterol and high triglycerides (both risk factors for heart disease) and they were given 2½ cups of freshly squeezed orange juice to drink daily for 90 days. The results showed a significant improvement in plasma antioxidants, and the oxidation of the lipids (fats) decreased significantly. Regular consumption of orange juice increased HDL (good cholesterol) levels.Other uses The fruit of the orange has been shown to be cooling, digestive and carminative (relieves wind), and has tonic properties. It was traditionally used in asthma, to reduce vomiting, to purify the blood, for coughs, fevers, thirst, hiccoughs and for indigestion.Orange segments The different parts of the orange have different effects in your body. Fruit The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of orange consumption are useful in the prevention of chronic illness and have been shown to reduce neurotoxicity when consumed regularly. In mice, the antioxidant effects reduced neurodegenerative changes of the Alzheimer’s type.Drinking the juice of red (blood oranges) every day for seven days improved endothelial (arterial wall) function, reducing the risk for atherosclerosis and heart disease in 19 human subjects. This effect was attributed to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.Orange peel extract Dried sweet orange peel and dried ripe (and unripe) fruits of Seville (bitter) orange are ancient Chinese remedies. They are used for indigestion (the primary indication is to relieve heartburn), stubborn coughs and anal and uterine prolapses, also for treating shock in higher doses. Orange peel extract has improved the circulation of blood through the heart and cerebral tissue.The dried peel of the common orange (Citrus sinensis) was shown to reduce thyroid overactivity, lower blood glucose and stimulate insulin as well as reducing lipid (fat) peroxidation, indicating a potential for use in hyperthyroidism and diabetes. Orange peel is a rich source of flavonoids, compounds that are associated with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-tumour activities.Essential oils Orange oil has been shown to be strongly antimicrobial compared to several antibiotics. It appears to be more effective than lemon oil as an antibacterial and antifungal. Limonene is the main antimicrobial active ingredient. These antimicrobial properties can also be useful in food preservation. D-limonene exhibits anti-stress activity (by inducing the release of the hormone dopamine) and anti-inflammatory effects when taken as a dietary supplement.The aroma of sweet orange oil has a marked anti-anxiety effect in human subjects. As well as sweet orange, oils from other varieties include neroli oil from Seville orange flowers, and pettigrain oil from its leaves. Bergamot orange oil is a major component of the famous eau de cologne.Other uses Orange flower water relieves colic in babies. It is a by-product of neroli oil manufacture. Orange flower water is also used in desserts.The bergamot oil is used to flavour Earl Grey Tea and is calming and relieves headaches.Next time you eat an orange (preferably an organic one), keep the skins, dry them and use these in your home medicine kit.Using orangesEat the fruit as a food or drink the freshly squeezed juice. As with all fruit, it’s better not to consume large quantities, especially of the juice, because of the high sugar content. Commercial juices have lower vitamin C content. The whole fruit is best as it still contains the fibre component. For cooking, Seville oranges are considered the best for marmalade, and the essential oils extracted from the unripe fruits are the key flavour in the liquors Grand Marnier, Cointreau, Triple Sec and Curacao.",

In addition to being downright delicious, especially at their peak, peaches offer some unique health benefits. Here are six reasons to get your fill of this gorgeous, fuzzy fruit.They Support Your Immune SystemPeaches support immunity in three ways. An average peach (about 5 ounces) contains 6 milligrams of vitamin C, which is 7% of the Recommended Daily Amount (RDA) for men and 8% for women.1 Several types of immune cells need vitamin C for their production, function, and protection.Peaches also contain vitamin A, which plays a role in keeping your lungs and other organs healthy.5 The third way peaches support immunity is by way of their natural antimicrobial properties, which means certain components in peaches help fight off bacteria and other bugs that can make us sick.6They Have Antioxidant Properties Peaches contain antioxidants—polyphenols and carotenoids specifically. Antioxidants are known to combat oxidative stress, which is an imbalance between the production of cell-damaging free radicals and the body's ability to counter their harmful effects. That's key for brain health, as oxidative stress is known to be a causative factor in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease. You Might See Healthier Skin Peaches have beta carotene and vitamin C: Both have been shown to support healthy skin. Beta carotene, a precursor to vitamin A, helps protect skin from sun damage.7 Additionally, vitamin C is needed to build collagen and improve skin elasticity.Further, increasing water intake has been shown to have a positive effect on skin hydration.8 Because a fresh peach contains about 88 grams of water, peaches may also be hydrating for your skin (and body as a whole).Peaches May Support Eye Health The lutein and zeaxanthin in peaches help protect the retina and lens. These two carotenoids have been shown to reduce the risk of two common eye disorders—macular degeneration and cataracts.9The vitamin A in peaches also helps support healthy vision. While rare, a true deficiency of vitamin A can lead to a condition called xerophthalmia, which can damage normal vision and result in night blindness (the inability to see in the dark or low light).10",

        detail1:"Gardenia (Gardenia jasminoides) is a flowering plant native to southern China. Its fruit has been used in Asian traditional medicines for centuries.Gardenia contains a chemical that might reduce insulin resistance and help prevent high blood sugar. Other chemicals in gardenia might reduce swelling and protect the liver. People use gardenia for diabetes, high blood pressure, insomnia, anxiety, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.1. Helps Fight Inflammatory Diseases and Obesity Gardenia essential oil contains many antioxidants that fight free radical damage, plus two compounds called geniposide and genipin that have been shown to have anti-inflammatory actions. It’s been found that it may also help reduce high cholesterol, insulin resistance/glucose intolerance and liver damage, potentially offering some protection against diabetes, heart disease and liver disease. (6)Certain studies have also found evidence that gardenia jasminoide may be effective in reducing obesity, especially when combined with exercise and a healthy diet. A 2014 study published in the Journal of Exercise Nutrition and Biochemistry states, “Geniposide, one of the main ingredients of Gardenia jasminoides, is known to be effective in inhibiting body weight gain as well as improving abnormal lipid levels, high insulin levels, impaired glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance.” (7)2. May Help Reduce Depression and Anxiety The smell of gardenia flowers is known to promote relaxation and help people who are feeling wound up de-stress. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, gardenia is included in aromatherapy and herbal formulas that are used to treat mood disorders, including depression, anxiety and restlessness. One study out of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine published in Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine found that the extract (Gardenia jasminoides Ellis) demonstrated rapid antidepressant effects via instant enhancement of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the limbic system (the “emotional center” of the brain). The antidepressant response started roughly two hours after administration. (8)3. Helps Soothe the Digestive Tract Ingredients isolated from Gardenia jasminoides, including ursolic acid and genipin, have been shown to have antigastritic activities, antioxidant activities and acid-neutralizing capacities that protect against a number of gastrointestinal issues. For example, research conducted at Duksung Women’s University’s Plant Resources Research Institute in Seoul, Korea, and published in Food and Chemical Toxicology, found that genipin and ursolic acid may be useful in the treatment and/or protection of gastritis, acid reflux, ulcers, lesions and infections caused by H. pylori action. (9) Genipin has also been shown to help with digestion of fats by enhancing production of certain enzymes. It also seems to support other digestive processes even in a gastrointestinal environment that has an “unstable” pH balance, according to research published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry and conducted at Nanjing Agricultural University’s College of Food Science and Technology and Laboratory of Electron Microscopy in China.

        detail2:"Strawberries, like other berries, are rich in vitamins, minerals, fiber, and compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As part of a nutritious diet, they can help prevent various conditions.BenefitsThe nutrients in strawberries help support the body’s defense against the below conditions.1. Heart disease Strawberries might help protect against heart disease due to their anthocyanin and quercetin content. A 2019 studyTrusted Source reports anthocyanin has links with a lower risk of heart attacks. Additionally, quercetin has anti-inflammatory properties that appear to reduce the risk of atherosclerosis, according to 2016 researchTrusted Source. Potassium in strawberries also supports heart health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Trusted Source state that there is an inverse relationship between the consumption of potassium and the risk of heart disease. 2. Stroke A 2016 meta-analysisTrusted Source examined 11 clinical trials to assess the association between dietary flavonoid intake and stroke. It found that consuming these compounds may have an inverse link with the likelihood of the condition. After adjusting for the results for cardiovascular risk factors, the authors concluded that a diet higher in flavonoids may moderately reduce the risk of stroke.3. Cancer The nutritious compounds in strawberries and other berries may help protect against certain cancers, according to a 2016 reviewTrusted Source. They are primarily helpful in preventing gastrointestinal and breast cancers, but to a lesser extent, they may help prevent lung, prostate, liver, and pancreatic cancers. However, it is important to note that the cited studies were animal studies, which did not look specifically at strawberries, but berries in general. Rather than identifying one compound responsible for this protection, the authors speculated that the benefit likely stems from a combined effect of all the compounds in strawberries working together. In conclusion, consuming strawberries may offer some protection against oral, breast, lung, and esophageal cancers, but more research is necessary. Find out about the different types of cancer.4. High blood pressure The potassium in strawberries might offer some benefit for people with high blood pressure. This is due to how the substance helps offset the negative effects of sodium in the body, reports research in 2018. The authors found that increasing the intake of potassium-rich foods can lower blood pressure, which helps prevent heart attacks and strokes.",

Plus, these small fruits offer a few impressive health benefits.Kiwis, also known as kiwifruit, are a type of fruit native to the mountains and hillsides of Southwest China (1Trusted Source).They’re now grown in many other areas of the world, including New Zealand, which is a top producer of this popular fruit. Kiwis are also grown in many other areas of the world, including the United States.Kiwis were first brought to New Zealand in 1904 by a schoolteacher named Isabel Fraser, who brought kiwi seeds back home with her after traveling through China. Once known as Chinese gooseberry, kiwis were given the name “kiwi” by New Zealand fruit exporters after the flightless kiwi birds, which are endemic to New Zealand (1Trusted Source).Botanically, kiwis are classified as berries. Actinidia deliciosa and A. chinensis are the two most commonly consumed kiwi species (2).The most popular type of A. deliciosa kiwi is the Hayward kiwi, a green kiwi named after a man named Hayward Wright, who popularized kiwis in New Zealand in the 1920s (2).  Hayward kiwis are oval in shape and about the size of a large hen’s egg. They have fuzzy brown skin, green flesh, and tiny black seeds (3).Kiwis also come in yellow-fleshed or golden varieties (A. chinensis). The difference between green-fleshed and yellow-fleshed kiwis is that green kiwis contain a green pigment called chlorophyll while yellow kiwis do not (3).It should be noted that kiwis are not the same species as kiwiberry. Even though they belong to the same plant family, Actinidia, kiwiberries are small and have edible, grape-like skin.Kiwis are larger and have thicker, fuzzy skin. The skin of most varieties of kiwi should be peeled off before you eat them. However, some people like to eat the skin of golden or yellow kiwi varieties because the skin is softer than the skin of green kiwis. ",
